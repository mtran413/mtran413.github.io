          <h1>Hello! I’m Michelle.</h1>
            <p> I am a senior at Pomona College studying <b>Cognitive Science.</b> <br> </p>

            I am a user experience researcher passionate about creating <b>accessible</b> and <b>intuitive</b> experiences for users, especially for <b>underrepresented groups</b> such as first-generation low-income identities and English as second language users.
 </b> <br>
      <br>
      Being a first-generation low-income student and having parents who speak English as their second language made me passionate about making technology more <b>accessible and beneficial</b> for these groups, as well as other underrepresented communities.
